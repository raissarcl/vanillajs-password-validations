# Password Validations with Vanilla Javascript

## Summary
Simple validations with Vanilla Javascript with two different approaches: with and without Regular Expressions (ReGex). The `validate-password.js` contains the version without regex and `validate-password-regex.js` with regex. An interface for a better visualization will be added in the near future.

## Validations 

- Character **amount** between **6 and 20**.
- At least one **lowercase** character.
- At least one **uppercase** character.
- At least one **number**.
- No **repeated characters** three or more times in a row.
